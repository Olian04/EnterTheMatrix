# EnterTheMatrix

[![demo gif](matrix-effect-demo.gif)](https://olian04.github.io/EnterTheMatrix/)

Small silly project that adds a function called `EnterTheMatrix` to the window object. Calling this method will fullscreen a "matrix" effect (like in the movie).

I made this because i like to include this effect as an easter egg in most of my websites.

[Demo](https://olian04.github.io/EnterTheMatrix/)

```html
<button onclick="EnterTheMatrix()">Enter the matrix</button>
